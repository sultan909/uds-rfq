# Progress

## What Works
- Memory Bank documentation structure initiated and aligned with PRD.
- Customer view, edit, and history pages implemented with navigation from the customer list.
- Inventory detail page includes SKU item history section.
- Sidebar is collapsible, toggle button is always visible, and tooltips are shown in collapsed mode for navigation clarity.
- Create Quote page implemented for RFQs, accessible from both RFQ Management and RFQ Detail pages.
- 'Add New RFQ' button added next to the search button on the RFQ Management page.
- SKU mapping dialog is now a reusable component, supports full CRUD (add, update, delete), and is fully integrated with backend (PUT method for full replacement).
- Customer autocomplete and batch update logic are in place for SKU mapping.
- AllMappings and RecentlyAdded tabs use the shared dialog and backend sync.

## What's Left to Build
- Further UI/UX refinements based on user feedback.
- Continue implementing advanced PRD features (e.g., deeper integrations, analytics, more filters, etc.).
- Ongoing accessibility and usability improvements.
- Monitor and optimize backend-frontend sync for SKU mapping.

## Current Status
- UI/UX improvements and PRD feature delivery are in progress, with quote creation, SKU mapping dialog refactor, and navigation enhancements recently completed.

## Known Issues
- No major issues; backend-frontend sync for SKU mapping is being monitored for edge cases and performance.
